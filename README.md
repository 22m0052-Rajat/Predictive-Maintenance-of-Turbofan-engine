Introduction
Predictive maintenance is a crucial aspect of ensuring the reliability and longevity of turbofan engines used in various applications such as aviation and power generation. This repository provides tools and techniques to predict potential failures or maintenance needs of a turbofan engine using machine learning and data analysis.

Installation
To get started, follow these steps to set up the environment:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/22m0052-Rajat/predictive-maintenance-of-turbofan-engine.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd predictive-turbofan-maintenance
Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare your turbofan engine sensor data in a suitable format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
Modify the config.yaml file to customize model parameters and data paths.
Refer to the Usage Guide for detailed instructions.

Data
The dataset used for this project is available from source link '_RUL_FD001.txt_' & '_train_FD001.txt_'. It includes sensor readings and maintenance logs from a fleet of turbofan engines. Please review the dataset documentation and terms of use before utilizing it for analysis.

Methods
We employ a combination of machine learning techniques, including time series analysis and anomaly detection, to predict the maintenance needs of turbofan engines. The main steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

For a detailed overview of the methods and algorithms used, please refer to our Methods Document.

Results
Our predictive maintenance model achieved an accuracy of 90% in identifying impending turbofan engine failures. Detailed results and analysis are available in the Results Document.
